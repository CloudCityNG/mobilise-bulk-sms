        <p>Hey there!</p>
        <p>
            Guess what? We hate going about our job, day in and day out, with no human contact.
            We love someone who'd like to talk to us or tell things to our face,
            someone who we can bounce ideas with or team up with, or someone who would just make friends with us!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you want to put a face to the name Quic-SMS, you can drop in at our Lagos office:
            6th floor, Buffalo Building, No 2 Allen Avenue, Ikeja.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            And if you're shy or busy and also, online friendly (which true-blue FreeChargers are all about), drop in a
            line at: support@quicsms.com (for customer support queries), partner@quicsms.com (if you want to partner with us)
            or careers@quicsms.com (for career opportunities).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We'll write back. Promise!
        </p>
